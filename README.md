# udacity-alx-nanodegree-2022
## investigate-a-dataset
First project of the Udacity ALX nanodegree 2022
Main action was to check a preferred dataset for insights and in this case the European soccer database was used containing data from a range of top football leagues in Europe across a few seasons.  
The Belgium Jupiler League was selected as a case study and insights were reported and documented as part of the project rubric.
Due to github file size restriction, dataset is not included but a link to it might be added later on.
